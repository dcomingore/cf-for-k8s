# Rotating Secrets
Most secrets in cf-for-k8s can be rotated by simply changing the values in your `cf-values.yml` file and running a standard deploy using ytt and kapp. The rotation is complete when the kapp deploy succeeds.

## Exceptions

The following fields currently cannot be rotated:

* `blobstore.secret_access_key`
* `capi.database.encryption_key`
* `capi.database.password`
* `cf_admin_password`
* `cf_db.admin_password`
* `uaa.database.password`

For example, rotating the cloud controller db encryption key is a breaking change. Rotating the key will 
require a recreating your environment (including deleting database contents) in order to prevent decryption errors when fetching
previously-saved data.

If you find you must rotate one of the above fields: 

1. Delete your cf with `kapp delete -a cf`
1. Then, in your `cf-values.yaml`, you will need to update the properties that need rotating.
1. Enter your updated values and rerun `kapp deploy -a cf ...`. 

## Specific Issues

### Outright Errors

* [Rotating non-admin user/role credentials in postgres fails](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s/issues/216) 

* [Support rotation of `blobstore.secret_access_key`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s/issues/527)

* [Support rotation of `capi.database.encryption_key`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s/issues/529)

* [Support rotation of `capi.database.password`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s/issues/530)

### Concourse/CI Issues

The following fields can be modified and are updated eventually, but
`uptimer`-type checking in the pipelines are currently configured to
use either the old password or the new one, and will fail.

* `cf_admin_password` - manual upgrade works, CI/upgrade fails

* `cf_db.admin_password` - manual upgrade works, CI/upgrade works

* `uaa.database.password` - manual upgrade works, CI/upgrade fails: "Error unmarshalling the following into a cloud controller error: no healthy upstream"

## Notes on Currently Supported Rotations

### Rotating Ingress Certificates
To rotate the application domain certificate or system domain certificate, you
can do the following:

1. In your `cf-values.yaml`, the system domain certificate is called
`system_certificate` and the application domain certificate is called
`workloads_certificate`. These two properties can be independently updated.
2. Redeploy using ytt and kapp. This will cause the secrets to be recreated and
successfully rotated in the Istio Ingress Gateway.

If you have multiple app domains, they all share the `workloads_certificate`.
You cannot rotate the app domains' certificates separately because there is only
one certificate.
